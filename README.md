# Welcome to Butler JCR GitHub

## To Successive Webmasters

Our website services are on here, and get auto-deployed. 

[I](https://github.com/premraghvani) Prem, as Webmaster first elected in 2025 have set it up such that
- Code runs on AWS Lambda (serverless; for cheaper stuff)
- Databases with DynamoDB, and AWS S3 buckets (binaries, and big JSONs)
- Emails sent with SES
- The frontend content delivered by API Gateway

I have set it up in a way such that you do not need to worry about anything (to the future webmaster). Things get depoloyed on the `main` branches of both repos,
directly to AWS Lambda.

If things go wrong, feel free to get in touch!

The domain is held on Porkbun.
